# Twitch-Account-Creator
First project by yasintr#0001 and Oberonskiiv2#0001

So if u did like 2k accounts, or it says that the usernames are already taken,  you have to do this:
Go in the Data folder where you see userdictionary.txt and delete it. Then download one of this file:
https://mega.nz/file/L0tGwQQZ#oaW7pEkiKvSu4QOMv37NRQwbFraVWWodfi3Alm-DiC0  (1mb usernames)
Or this one:
https://mega.nz/file/ntsgwa4R#ppkqEXFIRH8YnNJdtD0UsRI91ubNFvg-S-uygkvWqiA      (9mb usernames)
then rename it to userdictionary.txt and you are finished. 


Why to do that? 
Because the account creator just takes a line of the .txt and uses it as a username to create an acc. So if you did like 2k. It will grab an already taken username, and it wont work.
